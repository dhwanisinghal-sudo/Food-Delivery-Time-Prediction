# Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project focuses on predicting food delivery times using Machine Learning.  
It analyzes multiple factors including distance between restaurant and customer, preparation time, traffic conditions, and other order-related features. By leveraging a Random Forest Regressor, the model can provide accurate delivery time predictions, helping to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in real-world food delivery systems.

The project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature selection and analysis
- Model training, testing, and evaluation
- Prediction and performance visualization

Technologies used include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Google Colab.  
This project serves as a practical example of how machine learning can be applied to optimize logistics and enhance decision-making in delivery services.
