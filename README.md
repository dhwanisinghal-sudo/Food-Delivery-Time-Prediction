# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
Machine Learning project to predict food delivery time based on multiple influencing factors such as distance and delivery conditions. The model uses a Random Forest Regressor and includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and result analysis to demonstrate real-world ML applications in food delivery systems.
